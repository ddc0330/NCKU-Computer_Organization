# NCKU Computer Organization – Coursework

This repository contains homework assignments and course handouts for the **Computer Organization** course offered by the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at **National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)**.

## Course Topics

The course focuses on the interaction between software and hardware, with a particular emphasis on RISC-V architecture. Covered topics include:

- **Computer Architecture Basics**
  - Von Neumann architecture and data paths
  - Instruction cycle, ALU, and control units

- **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture**
  - Instruction types: R, I, S, B, U, J
  - Register operations, immediate values, and control flow
  - Assembly-level programming

- **Hardware–Software Interface**
  - How software is translated and executed on hardware
  - Role of compilers, assemblers, and machine code

- **Performance Considerations**
  - Pipelining concepts
  - Memory hierarchy and caching principles
